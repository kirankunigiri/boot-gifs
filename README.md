# boot-gifs
A collection of boot/respring gifs for phones.



## Use it

The folders contain a bunch of cool tweaks that can be used as boot or respring logos. The "Converted (iPhones)" folder usually has the coolest GIF's.

**iPhone Users:** The Usable folder contains GIF's that I have already converted into frames for use with the Springy Cydia tweak on iPhone 6+ sized screens. You can create frames for your own screen sizes using the BootGIF app.

**Android Users: ** Users can use the GIF without any conversion using one of the apps available on the play store, such as ROM Toolbox.



### Contribute

Feel free to add your own cool GIFS to the TODO folder.
